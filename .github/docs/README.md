# MDSG Agent Knowledge Hub

## 🤖 AI Agent Navigation System

This documentation serves as the **interconnected knowledge base** for AI agents working on MDSG. Use `copilot-instructions.md` as your entry point, then navigate here for detailed implementation guidance.

**IMPORTANT**: This documentation contains both **current working features** and **planned future features**. Always check the current implementation status in `copilot-instructions.md` first.

## 📍 Knowledge Map Structure

```

## 🔄 How to Navigate as an AI Agent

### 1. Start with Context (Always)
→ Read `../copilot-instructions.md` first for:
- **CURRENT REALITY**: What actually works (25/25 core tests passing)
- **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Monolithic vs Clean Architecture plans
- **BUNDLE METRICS**: 14.0KB current vs targets
- **WORKING vs PLANNED**: Feature status verification

### 2. Understand Current vs Future
**🎯 CRITICAL**: Documentation contains both working features and roadmap items.

#### ✅ CURRENT WORKING FEATURES
- Basic markdown parsing (headers, formatting, simple lists)
- GitHub OAuth authentication 
- Site generation and deployment
- Core test suite (25/25 passing)
- Bundle: 14.0KB gzipped (within target <20KB)

#### 📋 PLANNED FEATURES (In Documentation)
- Advanced markdown (syntax highlighting, tables, nested lists)
- Clean Architecture structure
- Performance optimizations (<12KB target)
- Comprehensive test coverage (64 additional tests)

### 3. Identify Your Domain
Based on your task, reference the appropriate detailed docs:

#### Frontend Development Tasks (CURRENT)
```
📝 Working on: src/main.js (1690-line monolithic file)
🔍 Primary docs: architecture.md (future patterns) + performance.md + security.md
🎯 Focus: Working within current structure, incremental improvements
⚠️ Reality: No Clean Architecture implemented yet
```

#### Backend Development Tasks (CURRENT)
```
📝 Working on: server.js (395-line OAuth proxy)
🔍 Primary docs: security.md + api.md + deployment.md
🎯 Focus: OAuth flow working, basic rate limiting implemented
✅ Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
```

#### Testing Tasks (CURRENT)
```
📝 Working on: tests/basic.test.js (25 PASSING) vs advanced tests (64 FAILING)
🔍 Primary docs: testing.md + copilot-instructions.md for test status
🎯 Focus: Maintain working core tests, implement advanced features gradually
⚠️ Reality: Most advanced tests expect unimplemented features
```
```
📝 Working on: tests/, CI/CD, quality assurance
🔍 Primary docs: testing.md + performance.md + security.md
🎯 Focus: Test patterns, coverage targets, security testing
```

#### DevOps/Deployment Tasks
```
📝 Working on: Build config, deployment, production setup
🔍 Primary docs: deployment.md + performance.md + security.md
🎯 Focus: Production checklist, security headers, monitoring
```

### 3. Cross-Reference for Complete Understanding
Always check multiple docs for comprehensive context:
- **Architecture decisions** impact performance and security
- **Security requirements** affect API design and testing
- **Performance constraints** influence architecture choices

## 📖 Document Interconnections

### Architecture ↔ Performance ↔ Security Triangle
These three docs form the core knowledge triangle:

```
    🏗️ Architecture
    ├── Hybrid approach rationale
    ├── Component design patterns
    └── Migration strategies
         ↕️
⚡ Performance ←→ 🔒 Security
├── Bundle optimization   ├── Input validation
├── Runtime efficiency    ├── XSS prevention
└── Monitoring setup     └── Rate limiting
```

### API ↔ Testing ↔ Deployment Integration
These docs work together for implementation:

```
🔌 API Reference
├── Endpoint specifications
├── Authentication flow
└── Error handling
    ↕️
🧪 Testing ←→ 🚀 Deployment
├── Test patterns        ├── Production config
├── Mock strategies      ├── Environment setup
└── Coverage targets     └── Security hardening
```

## 🎯 Quick Agent Decision Tree

### When Adding New Features:
1. Check `copilot-instructions.md` for decision framework
2. Review `architecture.md` for patterns and principles
3. Validate `performance.md` impact and budgets
4. Implement `security.md` protection measures
5. Add `testing.md` coverage for new functionality
6. Update `api.md` if endpoints are affected

### When Fixing Bugs:
1. Start with `testing.md` to reproduce issue
2. Check `architecture.md` for component understanding
3. Verify `security.md` implications of the fix
4. Ensure `performance.md` regression prevention

### When Optimizing:
1. Measure first using `performance.md` tools
2. Follow `architecture.md` patterns for changes
3. Maintain `security.md` protections
4. Update `testing.md` with performance tests

## 🧠 Agent Memory Aids

### Key Metrics to Remember
- Bundle size target: <12KB gzipped (current: 11.7KB)
- Performance target: 95+ Lighthouse (current: 98)
- Test coverage: >90% critical paths (current: 55+ tests)
- Security: A+ rating maintained

### Critical Patterns to Apply
- **Input validation**: Every entry point
- **Error handling**: User-friendly + secure
- **Performance**: Debounce + DOM efficiency
- **Security**: XSS prevention + rate limiting

### Architecture State to Understand
- **Current**: Monolithic main.js for speed
- **Prepared**: Clean Architecture for scaling
- **Decision**: Use monolithic for fixes, Clean for major features

## 📚 Documentation Quality Standards

### When Creating/Updating Docs
1. **Context First**: Why this matters for the project
2. **Patterns**: Concrete code examples
3. **Cross-references**: Link to related concepts
4. **Agent-friendly**: Clear navigation and decision points

### Agent Success Validation
Before completing any task, verify:
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] Security implications reviewed
- [ ] Test coverage maintained
- [ ] Documentation consistency preserved
- [ ] Architecture principles followed

## 🔄 Living Knowledge Base
