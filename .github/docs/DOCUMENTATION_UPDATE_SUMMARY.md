# Documentation Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Author**: AI Agent  
**Purpose**: Align documentation with actual project state based on commit history and current implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Updated MDSG documentation to accurately reflect the **current working implementation** versus **aspirational features**. The documentation now clearly distinguishes between what is actually implemented and working versus what is planned for future development.

## 📊 Key Findings from Analysis

### 2. `.github/docs/README.md` (Navigation Update)
**Changes:**
- ✅ **Current vs planned**: Clear distinction between working and aspirational features
- ✅ **Test status**: Accurate test count and status
- ✅ **Architecture reality**: Monolithic current state vs future Clean Architecture
- ✅ **Agent guidance**: Focused on working within current implementation

### 3. `.github/docs/performance.md` (Metrics Reality Check)
**Changes:**
- ✅ **Bundle metrics**: Updated to actual 14.0KB vs claimed 11.7KB
- ✅ **Performance scores**: Marked as "to be measured" instead of claiming 98/100
- ✅ **Target alignment**: Realistic targets (<20KB achieved, <12KB stretch goal)
- ✅ **Implementation status**: Current patterns marked as implemented vs planned

### 4. `.github/docs/testing.md` (Test Structure Reality)
**Changes:**
- ✅ **Test organization**: Actual file structure vs planned comprehensive structure
- ✅ **Coverage reality**: 25 working tests vs 64 planned tests
- ✅ **CI/CD status**: Core tests passing, advanced tests expected to fail
- ✅ **Testing philosophy**: Tiered approach focusing on working features first

### 5. `.github/docs/architecture.md` (Monolithic vs Clean Architecture)
**Changes:**
- ✅ **Current structure**: Acknowledged 1690-line src/main.js monolith
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Marked as planned/preparatory, not implemented
- ✅ **Migration strategy**: Clear triggers for when to evolve architecture
- ✅ **Decision framework**: When to use current structure vs plan migration

### 6. `.github/docs/api.md` (Current API Status)
**Changes:**
- ✅ **API reality**: Working OAuth server + client methods vs comprehensive API
- ✅ **Implementation status**: Basic GitHub integration working
- ✅ **Feature scope**: Current functionality vs planned enhancements

## 🔍 Key Corrections Made

### Bundle Size Reality
- **Was claiming**: 11.7KB gzipped total
- **Actually measured**: 14.0KB gzipped (10.8KB JS + 3.2KB CSS)
- **Impact**: Still within excellent range (<20KB target), but documentation was inaccurate

### Test Status Clarity
- **Was claiming**: 55+ comprehensive tests
- **Actually working**: 25/25 core tests ✅ + 64 failing advanced feature tests
- **Clarification**: Advanced tests expect unimplemented features (syntax highlighting, tables, etc.)

### Feature Implementation Status
- **Was claiming**: Advanced markdown parsing implemented
- **Actually implemented**: Basic markdown only (headers, formatting, simple lists)
- **Reality**: Advanced features are in test files but not in implementation

### Architecture Current State
- **Was implying**: Clean Architecture structure exists
- **Actually exists**: Single 1690-line src/main.js file with full functionality
- **Clarification**: Clean Architecture is planned for future, current structure works well

## 🚀 Benefits of This Update
