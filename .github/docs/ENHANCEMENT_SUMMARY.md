### 2. **Quick Commands Reference** (NEW)
Added always-visible command summary:

```bash
# 🏃 Development (Most Used)
npm run dev              # Frontend dev server ✅
npm run dev:server       # Dev OAuth helper (optional) ✅
npm run test tests/basic.test.js  # Core tests (25/25 ✅)

# 📦 Build & Deploy
npm run build           # Production build → 14.0KB ✅
npm run size            # Check bundle size
npm run lint            # Code quality ✅
```

**Benefits**:
- Immediate access to key commands
- Status indicators for reliability
- Contextual notes about usage

### 3. **Enhanced Decision Support Framework** (IMPROVED)
Transformed information gathering into visual decision trees:

```
🔍 STARTING A TASK?
├── Check Dashboard Above → Current metrics & status
├── Identify Domain → Frontend/Backend/Testing/Docs
├── Verify Bundle Impact → npm run size (target: <20KB)
└── Reference Cross-Docs → Use navigation map

🎯 IMPLEMENTING FEATURES?
├── Core Feature? → Add to basic.test.js (25/25 ✅)
├── Advanced Feature? → Check planned tests (64 pending)
├── Bundle Impact? → Monitor 14.0KB baseline
└── Architecture Change? → Consider Clean Architecture triggers
```

**Benefits**:
- Visual decision pathways
- Clear escalation procedures
- Contextual guidance at decision points

### 4. **Emergency Protocols** (NEW)
Added critical failure response procedures:

```
🚨 IF CORE TESTS FAIL (25/25 status broken):
1. Stop all feature development
2. Investigate regression immediately  
3. Restore working state
4. Update documentation if needed

🚨 IF BUNDLE SIZE EXCEEDS 20KB:
1. Analyze bundle composition (npm run size)
2. Identify size regression source
3. Optimize or revert changes
4. Update performance documentation
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear failure response protocols
- Prevents cascading issues
- Maintains system stability

### 5. **Live Site Integration** (CORRECTED)
Added prominent live site references throughout:

- **Live URL**: https://mdsg.daza.ar/ (GitHub Pages)
- **Architecture**: Frontend-only static site (corrected from backend claims)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- **Authentication**: Direct GitHub OAuth (no backend server)

**Benefits**:
- Accurate architecture understanding
- Live site visibility for testing
- Correct deployment model

### 6. **Documentation Validation System** (NEW)
Created comprehensive validation script:

**File**: `.github/scripts/validate-docs.js`
**Features**:
- Bundle size consistency validation
- Architecture claims verification
- Test documentation accuracy
- Cross-reference integrity
- Documentation location enforcement

**Benefits**:
- Automated documentation quality assurance
- Prevents documentation drift
- Enforces location standards

### 7. **Enhanced Feature Status Legend** (IMPROVED)
Clear visual indicators for implementation status:

- **✅ WORKING**: Features with passing tests in basic.test.js (25/25)
- **🚧 IN PROGRESS**: Features partially implemented or being developed
- **📋 PLANNED**: Features described in docs/tests but not implemented
- **🔧 BASIC**: Features with minimal implementation, needs enhancement

**Benefits**:
- Instant understanding of feature readiness
- Clear development priorities
- Prevents overestimating capabilities

### 8. **Success Metrics Tracking** (NEW)
Auto-update target system:

```
📊 CURRENT BASELINE (Update when changed)
- Bundle Size: 14.0KB gzipped (target: <20KB ✅, stretch: <12KB)
- Core Tests: 25/25 passing (target: 100% core ✅)
- Advanced Tests: 0/64 passing (target: incremental implementation)
- CI/CD Health: All workflows passing ✅
- Architecture: Frontend-only static site (target: maintain simplicity)
```

**Benefits**:
- Trackable success metrics
- Clear update responsibilities
- Progress visibility

### 9. **Enhanced Cross-Reference System** (IMPROVED)
Improved navigation with corrected paths:

```
🎯 ENTRY POINT: copilot-instructions.md (this file)
├── 🏗️ .github/docs/architecture.md     → System design & patterns
├── 🔌 .github/docs/api.md              → API reference & integration
├── 🧪 .github/docs/testing.md          → Testing strategy & implementation
├── 🚀 .github/docs/deployment.md       → Production deployment guide
├── ⚡ .github/docs/performance.md       → Performance optimization
├── 🔒 .github/docs/security.md         → Security implementation
└── 📚 .github/docs/README.md           → Documentation overview
```

**Benefits**:
- Accurate file path references
- Enforced documentation location (.github/docs/)
- Clear navigation hierarchy

### 10. **Architecture Reality Correction** (CRITICAL)
Fixed major architectural misunderstanding:

**Previous Claims**: Backend server with OAuth proxy
**Current Reality**: Frontend-only static site with direct GitHub OAuth

**Corrections Made**:
- server.js role: development convenience only
- Production: Pure static site at https://mdsg.daza.ar/
- Authentication: Direct GitHub API integration
